Simon Game
==========


###     Description
One of my earlier projects, I created this game as one of the projects required to complete the front-end developer
certification at freecodecamp. Originally developed on codepen, and moved to github. This game is based on the famous
[Simon Game](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/simon_game). You can check it out right
